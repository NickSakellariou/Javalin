## Overview

This is the web application that was created for my thesis. The topic of the thesis is the design and the development of an online bookstore that includes a Recommender System which shows books to the user on the home page based on ratings he has left in books. In particular, the Collaborative Filtering method is used, which tries to find the user's preferences based on the preferences of other users. The technologies that were used include Javalin, MySQL, Vue.js, Bootstrap and finally Apache Spark and more specifically, the MLlib library was used.
